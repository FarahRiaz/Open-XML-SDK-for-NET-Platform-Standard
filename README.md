# Open XML SDK for NET Platform Standard 3 & .net Core
a NET Platform Standard implementation of Open XML SDK 2.5 

This library(https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK) was the only library holding back our project from supporting .net core. I couldn't wait for a new release supporting .Net Core, so i copy the code and i tried this out.

Guess what, it went well. What we use seems to be fine.

I had to copy some classes from core-fx repo to make it work in Utility.Xml project. Also some errors are quickly dirty fixed.
